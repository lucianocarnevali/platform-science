# Platform-science
Platform Science Code Exercise

## Setup
`$ npm setup`

## Execution example
Go to the src folder. <br />
`$ cd src`
You have to provide two arguments, -s for shipments address file path and -d for drivers name file path. <br />
`$ node platformScienceApp.js -s ../fixtures/shipments.txt -d ../fixtures/drivers.txt`

You can use your own data fixtures, you only need to use absolute path to the files.
